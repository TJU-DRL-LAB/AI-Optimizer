# RL with Other Representation

As we have already proposed a taxonomy which contains four major categories. 
We use this repo to contain the works on representation in RL which cannot be exactly divided into the four major categories.

A finer taxnomy may be proposed if the number of works contained in this category grows to a certain scale. 

## An Overall View of Research Works in This Repo  

This repo will be constantly updated to include new researches made by TJU-RL-Lab. 
(The development of this repo is in progress at present.)

| Method | Is Contained | Is ReadME Prepared | Author | Publication | Link |

## Installation

The algorithms in this repo are all implemented **python 3.5** (and versions above). **Tensorflow 1.x** and **PyTorch** are the main DL code frameworks we adopt in this repo with different choices in different algorithms.

Note that the algorithms contained in this repo may not use all the same environments. Please check the README of specific algorithms for detailed installation guidance.
